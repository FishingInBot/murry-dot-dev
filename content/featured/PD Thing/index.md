A Python framework that dynamically imports user‑submitted strategy functions and runs them in a round‑robin iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, playing each pairing for a random 250–350 rounds. It then computes average per‑round scores against each opponent and aggregates those results to rank strategies.
